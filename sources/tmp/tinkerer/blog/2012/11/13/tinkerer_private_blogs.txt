Tinkerer Private Blogs
======================

Jan Wrobel prepared some scripts to easily setup a Tinkerer blog behind wwwhisper
authorization layer on OpenShift platform. This can be useful for people wanting to
have private blogs accessible only to select visitors. wwwhisper uses Persona to
authenticate visitors. To grand someone access, only email address needs to be
specified, no site-specific password is created.

The setup scripts are here:
`https://github.com/wrr/wwwhisper-openshift <https://github.com/wrr/wwwhisper-openshift>`_

A demo blog can be found here:
`https://io-mixedbit.rhcloud.com/blog/ <https://io-mixedbit.rhcloud.com/blog>`_

The demo blog is configured to allow anyone access. You can use an *anything@mockmyid.com*
address if you don't want to create a real Persona just to see a demo.

Thanks Jan!
