[NetHogs](http://nethogs.sourceforge.net/) â€“ Monitor Per Process Network Bandwidth.

NetHogs is an open source nice small program (similar to Linux top command) that keeps a tab on each process network activity on your system. It also keeps a track of real time network traffic bandwidth used by each program or application.

*Ubuntu install*:

```
sudo apt-get install nethogs
```
